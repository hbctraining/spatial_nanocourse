# Guidelines

## Set Repository

- Start a git repository: `usethis::use_git()`
- Push this project to GitHub, follow these steps:

* Only once every 30 days, set up your github credentials: `usethis::gh_token_help()`
  * **NOTE** You may want to run this first (one time) to keep this token working in future sessions: `git config --global credential.helper store`
  
- Push repository to HBC github as private: `usethis::use_github(org="hbc",private=TRUE)`

## Set up work-space

-   [ ] Replace the title in this file to match the project's title
-   [ ] Modify `information.R` with the right text for this project, it can be used to source in other `Rmd` files. The main `Rmd` file in this directory can be used to show general information of the project if needed.
-   [ ] If you didn't provide the pipeline when creating this project:
        Use the function `bcbio_templates` to create templates inside `reports` for each type of analysis. For instance, for *RNAseq*:
    -   `bcbio_templates(type="rnaseq", outpath=path)` or
    -   `bcbio_templates(type="singlecell", outpath=path)`
    -   Then go to that folder and read the `README.md`

## Folders

-   `meta` should contain the CSV/YAML files used by *nextflow* or your pipelines
-   `scripts` should contain `sbatch` scripts or any custom scripts used in this project
-   `data` contains raw data, it can contains big data objects
-   `reports` contains `Rmd` and `html` together with their files that will be published and shared.
-   `final` contains the output of *nextflow*
-   `code` contains any other files that support custom analysis and don't generate a report
-   For any relevant client files or papers use the `docs` folder

## Guidelines for file naming

[AnalysisType]_[BiologicalQuestion]_[YYYYMMDD].[extension]

Some examples:

- `TwoGroupsDE_ADrelated_20241011.html`
- `singlecellClustering_SkinTissue_20242011.html`
- `singlecellClustering_SkinTissue-GenePositiveOnly_20242011.html`
- `DiffBind-TreatedvsHealthy_20242011.html`

## GitHub

-   [ ] Track in *Git* this `README` file
-   [ ] Track in *Git* files in `scripts`, `meta`, and `reports` that belongs to these type:
    -   **Note** Git add `*.Rmd *.R *ipynb *.sh *.yaml`. (feel free use `.gitignore` if you use a GUI for non-tracked files). *DO NOT* use `git add *`. *DO NOT* track `html/csv/figures`. *DO NOT* track files that you did not use for this project (i.e. irrelevant templates, placeholders)
-   [ ] Commit files and push to *Github* as necessary throughout the project, but especially when work is complete
